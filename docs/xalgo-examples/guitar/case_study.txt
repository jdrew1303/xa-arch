A Musician from Bamako Goes to Montreal:

Once it’s launched, Lichen can be used to simplify and expedite cross-border purchasing.

While in Montreal for the Jazz Festival, a musician from Bamako, Mali needed to quickly
replace her damaged guitar. She purchased the new one from the original French musical
instrument manufacturer’s direct sales website, and arranged for it to be sent by courier
to her hotel in Montreal. Since the vendor’s e-commerce application runs Lichen, it
automatically recognized her primary residence as being in Mali, even though the guitar
was being shipped from France to Canada. Lichen correctly calculated and displayed the
Mali import duty. To check the amount, she tapped on “Details” and saw there that the
valuation method is CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight), meaning that the duties payable are
calculated on the complete shipping value, which includes the cost of the imported goods,
the cost of freight, and the cost of insurance. Since Lichen is implemented directly in
the e-commerce site, she could choose to pay the import duty automatically so that the
shipment can be pre-cleared through customs, thus saving two days shipping time. She
accepted the notification and proceeded with payment to both the vendor and Mali’s revenue
agency. Since tax and duties were paid, the shipping manifest issued by the French vendor
contained all the documentation required for the courier to have this item pre-clear
Canadian Customs. As a result she received her replacement guitar in time for the concert.

Using Lichen saved her the hassle of initially having to pay the Canadian GST of 5%, as
well as Quebec’s QST of 9.98% in Montreal, attempting to claim back those amounts at
Montreal’s airport prior to departure, and then paying the 20% sales tax upon arrival back
at Bamako–Sénou International Airport.
